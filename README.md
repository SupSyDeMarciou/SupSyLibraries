# SUPSY LIBRARIES
## Description
The SupSyLibraries (SL) are a set of useful functions and types developped for (but independent from) the [**SupSyGameEngine**](https://github.com/SupSyDeMarciou/SupSyGameEngine). They are mainly divided into a **maths** and a **utils** section, introducing usefuls utilities when dealing with 3D graphics but also for programming in general. 
Functions and structures follow a standardized syntax (for the most part) to provide a smoother experience when using auto-completion and suggestions, but also so they can easily be remembered and infered from previous experience. All functions and most structures have detailled comments which explain how to use them.

## Prerequisites
This librairy is standalone and ready to be used as-is, no dependencies required.

## Synthax Overview
### Structures
Structures don't follow any specific naming convention other than just being as explicit as possible without becoming too annoying to type. However, functions which are tied to specific structures (which then effectively work as class methods) have naming rules which are explained later.

### Operators
Functions which correspond to mathematical operations are suffixed by the name(s) of the structure(s) on which they operate and if they operate on pointers then they are suffixed by either `_` or `_s` depending on wether the result is stored in a third structure or in one of the operands (generaly the first one).

>For example: <br>
>- `vec3 add3(vec3 a, vec3 b);` is an *add* operation between two `vec3` (which reduces to just `3`). <br>
>- `vec3* add3_(vec3* a, vec3* b, vec3* c);` is an *add* operation between two `vec3` but is assumed to work on the heap. Therfore an output pointer *c* is expected and the fuction has a `_` suffix. <br>
>- `vec3* add3_s(vec3* a, vec3* b);` is an *add* operation between two `vec3` but is assumed to store its result back into *a*. Therfore the function has a `_s` suffix. <br>
>- `vec2* mul2x2_2_s(mat2x2* m, vec2* v);` is an *mul* (multiply) operation between a `mat2x2` (reduced to `2x2`) and a `vec2` (reduced to `2`) assumed to store its result back into *v*. Therfore, the function also has a `_s` suffix (for "self").

### Functions
Functions which operate on a specific structure or which are tied to a specific process are prefixed by the name of said structure or process.
>For example: <br>
>- `void* dictGet(dict* d, void* key);` operates on structure `dict` and *gets* the element associated with a certain *key*. <br>

In addition, most structures have **constructors** and **destructors** for *stack* allocation as well as *heap* allocation which follow this synthax: <br>
> Let's say we are working with this type: `typedef struct MyStruct my_struct;`. Then: <br>
> - `my_struct createMyStruct(...);` and (sometimes) `my_struct MyStruct(...);` allocate an instance of `my_struct` on the *stack*.
> - `my_struct* newMyStruct(...);` and (sometimes) `my_struct* MyStruct_(...);` allocate an instance of `my_struct` on the *heap*.
> - `void destroyMyStruct(my_struct toDestroy);` frees the fields of `toDestroy` (defined only for structures which allocate some of their fields on the heap).
> - `void freeMyStruct(my_struct* toFree);` frees `toFree`.

Some functions have multiple *overloads* and are therefore suffixed with their specific purpose.
>For example:
>- `quat Quat(float x, float y, float z, float w)` allocates a quaternion `quat` on the *stack* <br>
>- `quat Quat_Euler(float yaw, float pitch, float roll)` allocates a **unit** quaternion `quat` on the *stack* **representing the rotation given by the Euler angles yaw, pitch and roll**. <br>

Some miscellanoeus functions are simply prefixed by `SL_`. These usually either work on built-in C types or are just not tied to any specific structure and/or process.

## Content Overview
### Types
Some types from `stdint.h` and others are redefined to have be shorter, namely: 
- `int[n]_t` -> `int[n]` where `n` is either `8`, `16`, `32` or `64`.
- `uint[n]_t` -> `uint[n]` where `n` is either `8`, `16`, `32` or `64`.
- `unsigned int` -> `uint`  

These are just for convenience's sake.
### Maths
The mathematical structures defined by the SL are:
- `[t]vec[n]`, a vector of `n` elements of type `t` where:
    - `n` is either `2`, `3` or `4`.
    - `t` is either ` ` (float), `d` (double), `i` (int), `li` (long int), `u` (unsigned int), `lu` (long unsigned int) or `b` (bool).
- `quat`, an quaternion of floats.
- `mat`, a matrix of floats of arbitrary size.
- `mat[n]x[n]`, a square matrix of floats of fixed size where `n` is either `2`, `3` or `4`.

Arithmetic operators such as addition (`add`), subtraction (`sub`), multiplication (`mul`), inversion (`inv`), scaling (`scale`) and many others are supported by all types for which they have a mathematical meaning (specificaly with regards to linear algebra). Some operators act on multiple structures at once to allow for more flexibility.
Most mathematical structures can be converted into any other when the conversion makes sense (for exemple a rotation matrix into a quaternion, a float vector into a cross-product matrix or any vector into any other of identical size).

Finaly, some famous mathematical constants like `PI`, `TAU` and `EULER_NUM` are given a definition.

### Utils
Utils mainly define general-purpose structures such as `array`, `list`, `hashtbl`, `dict` and `arenaAlloc`, alongside their corresponding constructors, destructors and accessors, as well as struture specific functionnalities.
Some of these have associated *macros* to make the user experience a bit more pleasant, but most of them are just wrappers around a function of identical name but with suffix `_P` (for "proper"). This makes it easier to interface with these functions as they usually work with `void*` pointers to make their functionnality independant of type.

Other functions include thoses defined in `inout.h` which are mainly prefixed by `SL_` and which operate on strings, either by analysing them or by printing to a certain output. Here you can find the *very-useful-yet-somehow-not-C-standardized* `char* SL_readFile(const char* path);` which dumps the the entirety of a file into a null-terminated string.
